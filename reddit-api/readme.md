# React Starter

## Description
A starting place for React Projects using React, Babel, and Webpack.  Feel free to use this as a starting spot for anything you want to build with React.

## Setup
1. Download the repo
2. npm install
  - downloads the dependencies

That's it.  Use this to create your own React Projects.

Once you have something you want to take a look at:
1. npm start
2. localhost:3000 in your browser

Ready for production?
1. npm run build
2. change the source of build.js from /build.js to assets/build.js

The other script,
```
npm run watch
```
watches the files, like the dev server, but actually builds the build.js file.  

## Versioning
* 1.0 - initial build and features
* 1.0.1 - changed source for build.js and updated readme
